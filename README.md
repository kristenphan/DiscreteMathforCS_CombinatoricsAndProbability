__Assignment description:__ Implement together a program that will play optimally in a tricky dice game! Your program will be given a list of dices and will decide who chooses the dice first (you or your opponent). When the dices are chosen, we will simulate 10000 throws. Each time your number is greater, you get $1 from your opponent. Conversely, each time your number is smaller, you pay $1 to your opponent. Your ultimate goal is to implement a program that always wins in such a simulation.
